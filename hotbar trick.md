Step 1: Go to a new world in single player<br>
Step 2: Execute a command to get boomcraft's book<br>
Step 3: Save it into your hotbar<br>
Step 4: Join the server where you are in creative, and open the saved hotbar section in your inventory<br>
Step 5: Take the book<br>
Step 6: Enjoy

Sometimes, servers block the custom item spawning, you could use strange tricks like the item frame trick (you use a command to put the book into the item frame, after you give it to yourself and you add it into yout hotbar saved, then you go into the server, you place it and a piston and push the item frame to get the book, look the screenshot)
